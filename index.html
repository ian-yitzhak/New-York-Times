      <b> By Dennis Overbye <br> <i> March 17, 2014 </i></b>
      <p>  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
       young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
       
    stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
 particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
  he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
   A potential hitch in the presumed course of <a href=""> cosmic evolution could
    have infused </a> space itself with a special energy that exerted a
     repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
     of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
 look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
 The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
  Those particles were not missing, but would be <a href=""> diluted </a> beyond detection, 
  
  like spit in the ocean.

“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,”
 Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
 Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
  and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. </p>

<h2> ‘As Big as It Gets’ </h2>

<p> In our own universe,
 it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
 forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield
  new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
   first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according
    to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert
 who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”

He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
 sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”

The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
 microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves
  a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as 
  hot as the surface of the sun.

Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, 
working in an experiment known as Bicep, 
for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
 reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
  for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to 
  The Astrophysical Journal. </p>
      
      
     

      <h3> The Theory Of Inflation </h3>

      <i> Astronomers have found evidence to support
       the theory of inflation, which explains how the
        universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the

Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.

“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
been lucky.”

The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry,
who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously
as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
tended his radio telescopes.

Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in
1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s
team, knocked on his door with a bottle of <a href=""> Champagne to tell him
the news. </a>

<h3> Spirals in the Sky </h3>




<p> Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. </P>


<br>

<br>
<p> Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford. </p>

<p> The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth.
Steffen Richter/Associated Press</p>


<br>
<br>

<p> In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.

This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
<br>
<br>
Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
<br>
<br>
“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.

<br>
<br>

The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough </p>
